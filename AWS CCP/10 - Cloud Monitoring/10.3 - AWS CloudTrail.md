# AWS CloudTrail

- CloudTrail provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS account.

- CloudTrail is enabled by default.

- Users can get a history of events/API calls made within the AWS account by:-
  
  - AWS Console.
  
  - SDK
  
  - CLI
  
  - Other AWS Services

- Users can transfer these logs from cloudtrail to S3 or cloudwatch logs.

- A trail can be applied to all regions (default setting) or a single region.

- Use Case:- when someone deletes a resource in AWS, check cloudtrail first.

## CloudTrail Events

There are three types of events tracked by AWS cloudtrail:-

- **Management Events**:-
  
  - These are he operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account.
  
  - Example:-
    
    - Configure security
    
    - Configure routing rules
    
    - Setting up logs
  
  - By default. trails are configures to log management events.
  
  - Users can filter **Read Events** (Events taht don't modify resources) from **Write Events** (That may modify resources).

- **Data Events**
  
  - By default, they are not logged as they are high volume operations.
  
  - They are S3 object level activity, like GetObject, DeleteObject or PutObject.
  
  - Another example of data events are Lambda function execution activity.
  
  - Users can separate read events from write events.

- **CloudTrail Insights Events**
  
  - CloudTrail Insights is a paid service.
  
  - It can be used to detect unsual activities in an account.
  
  - It analyzes normal management events to create a baseline, and then continously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns.
  
  - Anomalies will apper in CloudTrail console, theu will also be sent to Amazon S3 and users can also generate eventbridge event on anomaly for automations.

## CloudTrail Events Retention

- Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail.

- To keep events beyond this period, users can save them in S3 and then use Athena to analyze them.
