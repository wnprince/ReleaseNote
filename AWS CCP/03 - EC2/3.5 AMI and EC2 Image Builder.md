# Amazon Machine Images (AMI)

- AMIs are customizations of an EC2 instance. User can add their own config, settings, OS, etc.

- It leads to a faster boot and configuration time as the softwares are prepackaged.

- AMIs can be built for a region and then copied across other regions.

- EC2 instances can be launched through:-
  
  - Public AMI - AWS provided
  
  - Custom AMI - created and maintained by the user
  
  - AWS marketplace AMI

# EC2 Image Builder

- It is a service which is used to automate the creation of virtual images or container images.

- Users can automate, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs with this service.

- It can be run on a schedule (Weekly, or whenever updates are available)

- It is a free service, and users have to pay only for the underlying resources.

### How does it work

- Step 1 - The EC2 Image buider creates a builder EC2 insance in which the build components are applied.

- Step 2 - The builder is stopped and an AMI is created from it.

- Step 3 (Optional) - A test instance is created from the AMI to check if the AMI is working fine.

- Step 4 - The AMI is distributed across multiple regions
