# Elastic Container Service (ECS)

- ECS is used to launch docker containers on AWS.

- Docker is a software development platform used to deploy apps.

- Using docker, apps can be packaged in containers that can be run on any OS. Apps run the same on any OS.

- It can also scale up or down very easily. Also, multiple docker containers can run in the same server, all running different applications.

- For ECS, you must provision and maintain the infrastructure for it to run, i.e. create an EC2 instance for it.

- AWS takes care of starting and stopping the containers.

- It has integrations with ELB as well.

# Fargate

- Fargate is a managed container service. It is also used for launching containers.

- In fargate, you do not provision any infrastructure, AWS does that for you, hence making it simpler.

- It is a serverless offering.

- AWS runs containers for you based on the CPU/RAM.

# Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

- ECR is a private docker registry on AWS, just like Docker Hub which is a public registry.

- User can store docker images in ECR.

- Images stored in ECR can be used in ECS or Fargate to create containers.
