# Databases

- Databases are used to store data in a structured way.

- With databases, users can define indexes to query/search data efficiently. It can also be used to define relationships between datasets.

- Now-a-days, databases are optimized for a purpose and come in different shape, features and constraints.

## Different types of databases

- Relational Databases - They are similar to spreadsheets, but with links bbetween them. The data can be queried through using SQL.

- NoSQL Databases 
  
  - They are non-relational databases. They are built for specific data models and have flexible schema for building modern apps.
  
  - They are flexible, hence it is easy to evolve the data model, and also scalable, as they can be scaled out using distributed clusters.
  
  - They are highly performant and functional as they have been optimized fo rspecific data models.
  
  - The data is stored in JSON format. The data can be nested, new fields can be added anytime and it supports new types like arrays.

## Shared Responsibility Model

For databases, AWS takes care of:-

- Quick provisioning, High availability, vertical and horizontal scaling.

- Automated backup and restore operations and upgrades.

- Oprtating system patching

- Monitoring and alerting

Users can run databases on EC2 but they will have to manage everything, frmom backup to scalingm fault tolerance, high availability, patching, etc.
