# What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the **on demand** delivery of resources such as compute power, database, storage, etc.

- On-demand means that you get what you wabt when you want.

- Through cloud service platforms, you can provision the exact right type and size of computing resources you need.

- You can get as many resources as you want instantly.

- You can also access, servers, storage, databases and other applications through an interface.

# Models of cloud

There are deployment models of cloud:-

1. Private Cloud

2. Public Cloud

3. Hybrid Cloud

## Private Cloud

- It is a model where cloud services are used by a single organization, but it is not exposed to public.

- The company using it has complete control over it.

- It is highly secure for sersitive applications.

- It is best for fulfilling specific business needs.

- Eg. - Rackspace

## Public Cloud

- In public cloud, the resources are owned and operated by thrid-party cloud service provider and exposed to the public over the internet.

- Eg. - AWS, GCP, Azure.

## Hybrid Cloud

- In this type of cloud deployment, users have combination of on premise servers and public cloud services/resources.

- The sensitive assets can be controlled over the private infrastructure while having the advantage of flexibility and cost effectiveness of public cloud.

# 5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- ###### On demand self service:-
  
  Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from service providers.

- ###### Broad network access:-
  
  Resources are available over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms.

- ###### Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:-
  
  Users can share the same resources with security and privacy.

- ###### Rapid elasticity and scalability:-
  
  - Automatically and quickly acquire or dispose resources
  
  - Quickly and easily scale based on demand

- ###### Measured Service:-
  
  - Usage is measures.
  
  - You pay only for what you use.

# Six advantages of Cloud Computing

- ###### CAPEX (Trade Capital Expense) for OPEX (Operational Expense):-
  
  - You don't own any hardware.
  
  - Due to this, total cost of ownership and operation cost reduces drastically.

- ###### Benefit from massive economies of scale:-
  
  - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale.

- ###### Stop guessing capacity:-
  
  - Scale based on actual measured usage.

- ###### Increased speed and Agility:-
  
  - Because resources can be used on-demandusers can create, operate and do stuff right away

- ###### Stop spending money on running and maintenening data centers.

- ###### Go global within minutes.

# Problem solved by the cloud

- **Flexibility:-** Change resource type when needed.

- **Cost effectiveness:-** Pay-as-you-go, for what you use.

- **Scalability:-** Scale easily by adding more nodes instantly.

- **Elasticity:-** Ability to scale out and scale in when needed.

- **High Availability and Fault Tolerance:-** Build across data centers worldwide.

- **Agility:-** Rapidly develop, test and launch software applications.

# Types of Cloud Computing

There are three typed of Cloud Computing:-



## Infrastructureas as a Service (IaaS)

- It provides the building blocks for the cloud IT.

- Includes resources like networking, servers and storage.

- It has the highest level of flexibility.

- Easy parallel with traditional on premise IT.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- These are basically the services where the underlying infrastructure is managed by service providers.

- Using these, one can focus on deployement and management of the apps.

- Eg. - Elastic Beanstalk

## Software as as Service (SaaS)

- Complete product that is run and managed by the service providers.

- Eg. - AWS Rekognition
