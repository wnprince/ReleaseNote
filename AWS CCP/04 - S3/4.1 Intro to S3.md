## S3 Buckets

- S3 allows users to store objects (files) in buckets (directories).

- Buckets , must have a globally unique name across all regions and accounts.

- Buckets are defined at region level.

- Naming convention for a bucket:-
  
  - No uppercase
  
  - No underscore
  
  - 3-63 characters long
  
  - Not an IP
  
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number

## S3 objects

- Files in S3 are called objects.

- Each object has a key which is basically full path to that object -
  
  - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
  
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt

- Each key is composed of a prefix + object name

- There is no comcept of bucket within buckets.

- Object values are the contents of the body. Max object size is 5TB.

- If the user is uploading more than 5B,  then multipart upload has to be used.

- Other object attributes include metadata (system or user metadata), tags (for security/lifecycle) and Version ID (if version is enabled).
