# Introduction

- When we create multiple apps, they inevitably need to communicate.

- There are two patterns of communication:-
  
  - Synchronous Communications - Where the apps communicate with each other directy.
  
  - Asynchronous Communications - Where the apps process request based on some events.

- Synchrounous model is problamatic if there are sudden spikes of traffic.

- Asynchronous model can be created by decoupling the app ussing services like:-
  
  - SQS: works on queue model
  
  - SNS: works on publisher/subscriber model
  
  - Kinesis: It is a real time data streaming model

# Amazon SQS - Simple Queue Service

- SQS is one of the oldest AWS offerings.

- It is a fully managed queue, used to decouple apps.

- It scaled from 1 message per second to 10,000 per second.

- It has a default retention period of 4 days to maximum of 14 days, i.e. all the messages must be processed within this maximum retention period.

- There is no limit on the number of messages in a queue.

- Messages are the deleted from the queue after they are read by the consumer.

- It has low latency (< 10 ms on publish and receive)
