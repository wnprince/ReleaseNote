# Amazon SNS - Simple Notification Service

- Amason SNS is similar to SQS but is works on the publisher/subscriber model.

- The event publisher sends message to one SNS topic.

- As many event subscribers as we want can listen to SNS topic notification.

- Each subscriber will get all the messages sent to the topic.

- Each SNS topic can have upto 10,000,000 subscriptions and upto 100,000 topic limits.

- SNS subscribers can be:
  
  - HTTP/HTTPS requests (with delivery retries)
  
  - Emails, SMS messages, Mobile Notifications
  
  - SQS queues, Lambda Functions

# Amazon Kinesis

- Kinesis is used for real time big data streaming.

- It is a managed service used to collect, process and analyze real time streaming data at any scale.

# Amazon MQ

- SQS abd SNS are cloud native services, and they are using proprietary protocols from AWS.

- Traditional apps running from on-premise servers may use open protocols like MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, openwire or WSS.

- When migrating to cloudm instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS or SNS, we can use Amazon MQ.

- Amazon MQ is a managed Apache Active MQ.

- It is not serverless and does not scale as much as SQS or SNS.

- It has both queue feature and a topic feature.
