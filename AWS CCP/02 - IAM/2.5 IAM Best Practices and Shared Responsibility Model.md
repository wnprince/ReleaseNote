# IAM Best Practices

- Don't use root account for anything other than creating admin user.

- Each user in the organisation should be an AWS user.

- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups.

- Create strong password policy.

- Use and enforce the use of MFA.

- Create and use roles when giving permission to AWS services.

- Use Access keys for programatic access (CLI/SDK) .

- Audit permissions using credentials report and access advisor.

# Shared Responsibility Model

In IAM, AWS is responsible for:-

- Infrastructure

- Configuration and vulnerability analysis

- Compliance validation

Users are responsible for:-

- Creating users, roles, groups, policies and monitoring them.

- Enabling MFA on all accounts.

- Rotate passwords and keys on regular intervals.

- Use IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions.

- Analyze access pattern and review permission.
