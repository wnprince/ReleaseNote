- Statement:- One or more individual statements (required)

Each statement consists of the following properties:-

- Sid:- An idnetifier for the statement (optional)

- Effect:- Whether the statement allows or denies the access.

- Principal:- Account/user/role to which the policy is applied.

- Actions:- List of actions that the policy allows or denies.

- Resource:- List of resources to which the actions are applied to.

- Condition: Conditions for when the policy is in effect.

## IAM Policy Inheritence

Policy inhertience happens if a user is part of a group. The user will inherit all the permissions that are provided in the group policy.

If user is part of multiple groups, then he will have inherit permissions mentioned in the policies of both the groups.

If a policy is attached directly to a user, then it is called inline policy.
