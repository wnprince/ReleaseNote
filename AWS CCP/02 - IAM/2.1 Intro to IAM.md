# IAM - Identity and Access Management

- IAM is a global service which is ised to create users and assign roled to them. 

- The root account is created by default by IAM. It is best practice to not use it for anything or share with anyone.

- The root account should be used to set up one account which will be used to create other users amd dp other stuff

- A user in AWS is a person within your organisation. Users can be grouped together of two or more users perform similar function.

- Groups in AWS is a collection of users that perform similar functions. A group can only contain users, not other groups.

- It is not mandatory for users to be part of a group. Also, one user can be a part of multiple groups.

- Users and groups are created to allow people in the organisation to use AWS and to give them permissions to perform certain actions on AWS.

- Permissions are provided by assigning policies to a user or a group. Policies are basically JSON documents. They define what a user or a group is allowed to do on AWS.

- In AWS, you use least previlege principle while applying policies. Never provide a user with more privilege than a user need.
