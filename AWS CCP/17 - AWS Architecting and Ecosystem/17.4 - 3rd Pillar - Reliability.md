# Reliability

- It is the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

## Design Principles

- Test recovery procedures - Use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures.

- Automatically recover from failure - Anticipate and remediate failures before they occur.

- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability

- Stop guessing capacity - Use auto scaling wherever possible.

- Manage change in automation - Use automation to make changes to infrastructure.
