# General Guiding Principles While Architecting in AWS

- Stop guessing your capacity needs - Instead use auto scaling and scale based on actual demands

- Test systems at production scale - It allows you to make sure that your system is ready when you actually make your system live to the customers.

- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier - Using CloudFormation or Elastic Beanstalk

- Allow evolutionary architectures - Design based on changing requirements

- Drive architectures using data - Have a look at the actual data and then decide appropriate architecture/services.

- Improve through game days - Simulate applications for flash sale days.

## Design Principles

- Be Scalable - vertical and horizontal

- Resources should be disposable and easily configurable.

- Automation - Serverless, IaaS, Auto Scaling

- Loose Coupling - Monoliths become harder to maintain and scale.

- Services, not Servers - Don't just use EC2, use manages services, databases, serverless, etc.

# 5 Pillars of Well Architected Framework

- Operational Excellence

- Security

- Reliability

- Performance Efficiency

- Cost Optimization

**Note**: They are not something to balance or tradeoff, they are a synergy
