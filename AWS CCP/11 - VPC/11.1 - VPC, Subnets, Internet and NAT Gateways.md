# VPC and Subnets

- A VPC is a private network to deploy your resources (regional resources).

- Subnets allow you to partion your network inside your VPC

- There are two types of subnet - public subnet and a private subnet.

- Public subnets can be accessed from the internet whereas private subnet can not.

- To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route tables.

- We can put resources that require direct internet access to the public subnet, like, EC2 and ELB. whereas private subnets can be used to keep databases so that they are more secure.

# Internet and NAT Gateways

- Internet Gateways help VPC instances to connect to the internet.

- Public subnets have a route to the internet gateway, which connects to the internet.

- NAT Gateways are AWS manages gataways that allow instances in your private subnet to access internet while remaining private.

- Users can opt for NAT instances instead of NAT Gateways is they want to manage it themselves.
