# Network ACL (NACL)

- A Network Acces Control List or NACL si a firewall that controls the traffic from and to a subnet.

- It can have ALLOW or DENY rules.

- They are attached at the same level as the subnets.

- The NACL rules can only be attached to IP addresses.

# Security Groups

- A Security Group is a firewall that controls traffic to and from an Amazon Network Interface or EC2 instance.

- It can only have ALLOW rules. The rules can include IP addresses as well as other security groups.

# VPC Flow Logs

- VPC flow log captures information about the IP traffic going into your interfaces.

- It contains logs from:-
  
  - VPC
  
  - Subnet
  
  - Elastic Network Interface.

- It helps in monitoring and troubleshooting connectivity issues like when subnets are not able to connect to the internet.

- It can also capture network information from AWS managed interfaces like ELB, RDS, Aurora, etc.

- These logs can be exported to S3 or CloudWatch logs.

# VPC Peering

- VPC Peering is used to connect two VPC privately using AWS network.

- It will make them behave as if theu were in the same network.

- To create VPC peering, users must ensure that the CIDR range of the two VPC should not overlap.

- VPC Peering connection is not transitive, i.e. if VPC A is connected to VPC B and VPC A is also connected to VPC C, VPC C and VPC can not communicate with each other unless an actual connection is made between them using VPC peering.
